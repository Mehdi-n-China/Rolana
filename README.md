# Project Rolana
## Description:

Project Rolana is a Solana-pegged, self-hosted coin that runs on an optimized and minimalistic version of PoS.
The goal of Rolana is to provide a viable sidechain to SOL for gambling purposes.

### Problem to Solve:

Currently, the gambling scene is monopolized by a few giants of the industry. Online casinos have multiple issues like trust-based randomness or excessive fees.
The other alternative is gambling tokens or even gambling contracts on other main chains like SOL or ETH.
The problem here arises from the fact that these chains charge fees for every bet placed. This is because they are not made for handling the special type of transaction that a bet represents.

## Rolana's Solution

Rolana will make all on-chain bets completely free to place and completely fair, as the chain will provide a cryptographically secure and provable source of randomness.
It will also support an in-house game engine for handling community games, and the game developers will be rewarded for bets placed on their games.
The chain will also be regulated by a group of moderators who will be able to allow or reject games based on predefined standards. This will ensure the environment stays fair (good RTP) and enjoyable for all.

Status: This is a work in progress and is not meant to be run in its current state.

If you just discovered this page, then welcome.
Have a look around and feel free to use my code in any of your projects—just please credit me if you use a major part of the code.

If you are seeing this because of my uni application, then also welcome. Again, feel free to look around and evaluate my style.
Note: This is in no way a ready or even pre-alpha build. I will keep improving it over time and plan on releasing it as part of my first-year achievements in uni, but this repository is only meant to show you the type of projects I am interested in as part of my application.

This repository demonstrates coding style, modular structure, and logic—not usability.

#### Key modules:

Node Software (WIP)
Game Engine (WIP)
Wallet Software (Not Implemented Yet)
