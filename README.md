# My Node Project (WIP)

**Status:** Work-in-progress, not meant to run in its current state.  

This repository demonstrates coding style, modular structure, and logic. Key modules:

- `server.js`: Handles HTTP requests (conceptual)
- `db.js`: Manages data storage (placeholder logic)
- `utils.js`: Helper functions

## Note
The code is intentionally simplified for portfolio purposes. It shows architecture and logic rather than a fully running application.
